# Food Image Classification: Classical ML vs CNNs

## Overview
This repository contains experiments comparing classical machine learning methods and deep learning approaches for food image classification, based on the Food-101 dataset.

## Contents
- `classical_models_training.ipynb`: Classical ML models trained on EfficientNet V2B0 deep features.
- `neural_models_training.ipynb`: Custom CNN and transfer learning experiments.
- `report/Nasibu_Final_Report.pdf`: Full comparative study and results.

## Dataset
Experiments use a 10-class subset of Food-101 (pizza, hamburger, ramen, sushi, etc.).  
Dataset source: [Food-101](https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_food-101/).

## Requirements
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
